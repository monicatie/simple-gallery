## Design Motivation

`simple-gallery` is inspired by early web days where it was expected and maybe celebrated? that users were capable of customizing their own content with simple css and html.

`simple-gallery` rejects the notion that you need package managers and a build system, it embraces the idea of readable static websites

`simple-gallery` acknowledges that not all that is old is better and encourages the use of modern software libraries/practices as long as it doesn't sacrifice beginner friendliness and beginner code readability.
